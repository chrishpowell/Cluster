Read more on www.astrologicalassociation.com The ASTROLOGICAL JOURNAL 02.06.2020 Frank C. Clifford: A Practical Guide to Writers of Astrology In this article I'll be discussing the various ways in which astrologers can get their work published and offering advice about approaching magazines and publishers. I'll also provide some tips on how to start the writing process and to discover your niche as a writer. There are plenty of websites and books dedicated to writing and getting published. But I'd like to focus on what I've learned as a writer and publisher in the area of astrology. The CAREER ASTROLOGER 19.05.2020 Chet Zdrowski: Dane Rudhyar - Astrology for the Modern Psyche Dane Rudhyar is a towering figure in modern astrology. Long after his passing in 1985 he continues to have a pervasive influence on much of modern astrology, especially evolutionary and psychological forms. Many of his later works are relatively unknown and there are many treasures for coming generations of astrologers to discover in them. Here we'll be taking a look at his first astrology book, one of the craft's most ground-breaking and enduring classics, The Astrology of Personality. IVC CONSTELLATION NEWS 06.05.2020 Grazia Mirti: Lilith - Black Moon: An Ally in the Astrological Interpretation In this article I shall discuss the important role played by Lilith-Dark Moon in our astrological analyses. I have researched the effects of Lilith-Dark Moon for many years; I now regularly include the study of Lilith-Dark Moon in my daily astrological practice. In my view, it is important to consider Lilith-Dark Moon’s role in a wider sense: not only as a symbol of feminine empowerment and transformation, but also as a useful indicator of our unfulfilled wishes, lacks and areas of our lives which need to be more carefully addressed. The MOUNTAIN ASTROLOGER 20.04.2020 Ray Grasse: Saturn as the Key 'Karmic' Challenge of the Horoscope More years ago than I care to remember, I heard a visiting astrologer make the offhand comment that Saturn's placement in the horoscope indicates where one's \"key karmic challenge in this lifetime is.\" Having thought about that astrologer's comment quite a bit since first hearing it, I've come to believe there is indeed something unique about Saturn as representing an especially focused symbol of one's current life-challenges. Understanding Astrology 04.03.2020 Ray Grasse: StarGates: Planetary Portals and Windows in Time Besides making two groundbreaking scientific discoveries, the scientist Joseph Priestley published major papers on electricity, invented new apparatuses for the creation of electrical charge, isolated and named ten distinct gases, and wrote more than fifty books and pamphlets on politics, education, and faith.

            "No one can escape change in 2020. After a year of retrogrades, supermoons, and eclipses, the year will end with what astrologers are calling the \"Great Conjunction.\" This meeting between Jupiter and Saturn, which goes down on Monday, December 21, sets into action a course of events that will shape the next 20 years. For better or worse, personally and globally, major shifts are being set into action. So, how do you ensure that you see positive changes over this time, such as more money and great sex coming your way, rather than business losses and break-ups? Keep reading, but here's a hint: To properly set yourself up, you'll have to get focused and shake off any situations or people who only act as harmful distractions. Buckle up and read on. 2020 Overall\n" +
"Right from the get-go, 2020 asks us to make tough decisions. There is a full moon and lunar eclipse in Cancer on Friday, January 10. Lunar eclipses usually mean endings, which plays well into what happens two days later. On Sunday, January 12, Saturn (the planet of restrictions) conjuncts Pluto (the planet of death and rebirth) in business-minded Capricorn. Do you have one too many side projects? Are you dating people you're pretty 'meh' about? Cut 'em loose. This transit asks you to identify your goals and focus your energy on them. Those who work hard will be rewarded while those who spread themselves too thin will lose out. Yes, it's a tough ask, but you can do it. There are also full moons that double as lunar eclipses in Sagittarius on Friday, June 5, in Capricorn on Sunday, July 5, and in Gemini on Monday, November 30.\n" +
"2020 is also riddled with super moons, which are full moons during which the moon is closest to the earth. These are powerful times for manifestation. Mark them in your calendar as great dates to launch a professional project or practice sex magick. This year's supermoons occur in Leo on Sunday, February 9, in Virgo on Monday, March 9, in Libra on Wednesday, April 8, and Scorpio on Thursday, May 7. Everyone's love life may feel a little shaky during Venus retrograde from Wednesday, May 13 to Thursday, June 25. Venus rules beauty, love, and wealth. When she goes retrograde, communication in our love life tanks. The best way to survive is to practice lots of self-care because the better you feel, the more empathetic and loving you are to your partner(s).\n" +
"While bubble baths and massages are encouraged, avoid making major changes to your appearance during this time. It sounds like a scary retrograde, but it's an opportunity to examine how we express ourselves romantically. If we're brave enough to notice where we can improve and make the effort to do so, Venus retrograde can do wonders for your love life. Oh, and exes may appear during this time. It's actually even worse than Mercury retrograde in that regard. Towards the end of Venus retrograde on Sunday, June 21 there is a new moon and solar eclipse in Cancer. Eclipses are fun to watch but cause shake-ups and drama. It's best to stay inside having sex, reading, or getting a massage. A second solar eclipse happens in Sagittarius on Monday, December 14.\n" +
"Another major retrograde, Mars retrograde, occurs from Wednesday, September 9, to Saturday, November 14. Warrior planet Mars is about ambition, aggression, and hot sex. When it goes retrograde, we find ourselves craving softer intimacy. It's not the best time to make major business deals or plan an orgy, but it's perfect for making your lover breakfast in bed. We're all feeling lazy. The more you struggle against the effects of Mars retrograde, the harder this period is. So relax and take a nap (or 20).\n" +
"While 2020 asks us to focus and cut away what's no longer serving is, the year also encourages us to become more involved with our community. Especially during an election year, it's a great time to become involved with like-minded people. Lucky planet Jupiter enters humanitarian Aquarius on Saturday, December 19. Get out of the house, attend a local meet-up, or go to a party you've always been curious about. The friends you make now play a major role in your life for years to come.\n" +
"2020 ends with a massive celestial occurrence on Monday, December 21, that astrologers are calling the Great Jupiter-Saturn conjunction. What happens now creates massive change on a global and personal level and affects our course of action for the next 20 years. No pressure, right? Cut out distractions, focus on what matters, and get involved in your community. That is the recipe for success in 2020.\n" +
